# Final Project Design - CI-0136 2025-I

This document outlines the design of the final project for the **Software Design** course. It includes a brief description of the project and the UML diagram representing the architecture and relationships between the main components.

## Project Description

The project involves the development of an application designed to create a web platform that allows students to search for and schedule tutoring sessions with available tutors in various subjects. Each user will be able to view their tutoring sessions organized in a schedule, and to join these sessions, the system will integrate with more well-known video conferencing platforms. At the end of the tutoring session, users will also be able to provide feedback on the tutor or student.

The solution is designed following modular design principles and best development practices, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and ease of use under the MVC pattern and the use of blueprints.
